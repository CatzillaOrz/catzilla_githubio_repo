As far as I am concerned, the government should focus more on preserving natural environment and less on economic development.

Even though some people believe that the economic is most important things for now, especially in developing countries. As social beings, humans can never do without money and economic. Economic is the strongest enemy in all the developing countries and the same as developed countries. It has been widely acknowledged that healthy economic paves the way for a country to achieve the dream of the county, such as "American Dreams", etc. However, that does not mean what has been living on for billions years' planet, our home, the earth, should be ignore and is not worthwhile to fight for protecting it.

On the other hand natural environment is where our home is, just as Thomas Jefferson once expressed. To some extent, the essence contained within all school subjects. Without them, the building would soon collapse. In order to achieve our human being's future, it is imperative for us to protect the natural environment. Therefore, there is no excuse for anyone to shun the most fundamental task of protecting environment. In this regard, we may refer to Madame Curie, a Polish physicist and chemist famous for her pioneering research on radioactivity. She studied hard at school and earned her higher degrees. The subsequent scientific research made her the first person honored with two Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry, and there are also a lot of other scientists like her posted a lot of paper to prove that how badly have human being hurt the earth. Evidently, these unprecedented achievements owed much to Madame Curies's hardworking on protecting our environment.

On the other hand, the modern world values possible ways  living longer on earth with natural environment, which is a key to humans future. Only through interaction with each country can  human bings master the art of making a better world. This vivid demonstrates the significance of relating well to natural. At universities, there are more and more projects or group work assigned to find more ways to protect natural environment.The participation in any project requires the ideas of helping people to understand how important it is for human beings living on earth which still have good natural environment.During these course of  experiment, students work together, they will build some simulation of the earth on the computer. Just like different components of an engine, every factors is interrelated. If a single part break down, the whole engine may like a boom and it will break down forever. It is such a amazing experiment that depicts the hold life cycle of human and our earth and the value of  living with natural harmoniously.

To sum up,  the government should focus more on preserving natural environment because it is the fundamental task about our life. One the other hand, the governments all over the world should take less on economic development, we have already developed compare to 1000 years ago, we don't need to take risks to destroy the natural environment or the earth to develop the economic, it's stupid, you're killing yourself anyway.Every single day spent on campus ought to be cherished in our memories, as this crucial period in life definitely become a brighter future, isn't it?
